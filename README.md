# iOSWirelessDFU


iOSWirelessDFU Integration was made to Allow Users to Enter DFU Mode Wirelessly, this would be helpful for users who are having issues with connections previously due to faulty hardware or broken homebuttons etc.

Our Software is a revolutionary step towards Wireless Jailbreaking and Uploading Files to your iOS Device, something which everyone has struggled to create and near to impossible to create. Using Apple Server API's we are able to access locale iDevices connected to the Internet on Local iP only.

At this time we are only accepting a limited amount of users to have access to the new WirelessDFU Tool, we prefer to limit our users for beta reasons to ensure it is safe and fully stable before a full release. Limited Devices are only supported at this time but their will be a full list of supported devices further down below this information page.
